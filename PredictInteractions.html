    <p><a href="http://string-db.org/"> StringDB Interaction Data </a> has a collection of known and predicted protein interactions including direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations derived from genomic context, high-throughput experiments, (Conserved) Coexpression and literature mining. They have quantitatively integrated data from the sources for different organisms and transfered information between them based on orthology when applicable.As of October 15th, 2015, the database covers 9'643'763 proteins from 2'031 organisms.
</p>    
<p>
    The interaction scores were normalized by 1000 (Max possible score) to scale them to (0-1) level needed for the software.
</p>
<p>
    Sequences obtained from StringDB of the source organisms are grouped together into sets of query sequences using their KOG family mapping. We are calling this sets of query sequences "<i>Interaction-Units"</i>. The protocol used for merging is available here and a java implementation of the protocol is available here as a jar file. 
</p>

<p>
    PredictInteractions.jar works by first running RandomwalkwithRestart one the global network using the Interaction-Units as the start nodes. For all edges between interaction units obtained from MergeInteractions.jar, a [0-1] score is estimated to determine the evidence for the presense of that interaction edge in the target organism using the equation in figure X. An edge  IEx will have the edge weight of 1 if there are identical orthologs of the interaction-units of IEx in the target organisms and they are highly coexpressed with each other.

    The TransferExpression.java (detailed here) was used to summarize the expression levels of the Interaction-Units.
