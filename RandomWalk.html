    Let <em>G = (V, E)</em> be the graph representing a pairwise sequence similarity network, where <em>V</em> is the set of nodes (sequences), and <em>E</em>
    is the set of weighted undirected edges, where the bit-score from BLAST weight, which shows the strength of similarity between sequence pairs, is assigned
    as edge weights. We define the homology of a node <em>v</em> to set of start nodes <em>Q</em>, <em>p</em><em><sub>q</sub></em><em>(v)</em>, as follows:
</p>
<p>
    The random walk with restart method simulates a random walker that starts from one of the start nodes in <em>q</em>. At every step, the walker selects
    among the available neighbors, based on edge weights of the neighbors of the node he is currently in, with probability (1-<em>r)</em>, or goes back to query set <em>Q</em>, with probability <em>r</em>.
    The restart probability <em>r</em> imposes a restriction on how far the random walker can get away from the start nodes <em>Q</em>. With <em>r</em> close
    to 1, the probability vector reflects the local structure around Q, and as <em>r</em> gets close to 0, a more global view is observed.
</p>
<p>
    The local structure around Q being the determinant for identifying sequence homology, the default setting for <em>r </em>in Orthofuzz is 0.33.
</p>
<p>
    The probability <em>p</em><em><sub>v</sub></em><em><sup>t</sup></em>, the probability of the random walker to be at node v at step t, is initialized to 1/N for nodes in the
    query set, where N is the number of nodes in the query set and to 0 for all the remaining nodes.
</p>
<p>
The steady state probability <em>p</em><em><sub>v</sub></em><em><sup>final</sup></em> is a measure of the homology of the node <em><sup>final</sup></em> to the query set Q. The <em>p</em>    <em><sup>final</sup></em><em> </em>is estimated using iterative matrix operations shown in figure 1.
